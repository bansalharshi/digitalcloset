# My Closet
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
Many of us buy clothes online. As we continue to buy clothes online and tuck them away in out physical closet its easy to forget the amount of clothes we own and how much money we have already spend on it on a regular basis. When we buy clothes online, its also tedious to keep looking for the clothes we own to find new clothes to style with. For example, if we own a pair of nice jeans we might be able to create different looks based on the tops, jackets, accessories, etc. we pair it with. But, finding this jeans everytime we buy something new online can be a problem.

So, it would be nice to have a digital closet where we can store all the clothes we buy to reference when we buy new clothes online, to remind us of the money we have spent and come up with style outfits for any ocassion. In this project we build a digital closet. It has following functionalities. It lets you:
1. Create an account
2. Add clothes (or any other item in your wardrobe) with as much information as you want including name, price, brand, pictures, original product link
3. Display added items in the form of your own personal shop
4. Filter added items based on 3 main categories of clothes, accessories and shoes
5. Keep track of the amount of money spent on buying clothes by displaying a list of all the items along with price and total
